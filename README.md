# CS-252-DAW

Contributing authors: Daniel Opdahl, Noah Manaternach

Created for the CS-252 OOP with Java class in the fall of 2018 at Luther College. This was our final project for the class. This project is by no means complete or satisfactory by my standards, but it is as much as we could get done given the time frame. It is my hope that this project will be expanded on and/or forked to created better DAWs and to facilitate learning. (I know I learned a lot by creating this.)

Features we weren't able to implement/ ideas for future features: 
- Copy/ Paste
- Resample
- MP3 support
- Append
- Scrollable view for main display
- Visual, real time display of audio files and their wave form (akin to Audacity or Garage Band)
- Right click features
